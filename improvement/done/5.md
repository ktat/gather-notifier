# Resolve conflict feature

maybe activate gather tab and show configuration menu are conflict. 
So, remove automatically activate gather.town tab.

And add the button to activate gather.town tab to the top of the menu.

# Fix `Ctrl+U`

`Ctrl+U` for lunch time still doesn't work.

## Resolution: Ctrl+U Cannot Be Implemented

After investigation, it was determined that programmatically triggering Ctrl+U (view source) is not possible due to Chrome browser security restrictions. Chrome intentionally prevents extensions from simulating browser keyboard shortcuts to maintain security.

**Alternative implementation:**
- Lunch mode now only shows badge indicator ("L") 
- Disables notifications during lunch time
- Automatically switches to gather.town tab when lunch mode is activated
- User must manually trigger any gather.town features they need
