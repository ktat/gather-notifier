# Improvement WorkFlow

If I say "do improvement", do the following.

Read files under `improvement/*.md` order by file name as int.
And then do the task in the file.
Before starting task, create branch from current branch.
When task is finished, commit changes to the branch.
And `*.md` file which you did move the file to `improvement/done` directory.
Update document under the docs directory accoring to your changes.

If `improvement/*.md` are left, repeat this step.
