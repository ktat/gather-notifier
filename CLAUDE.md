# Improvement WorkFlow

If I say "do improvement", do the following.

Read files under `improvement/*.md` order by file name as int.
And then do the task in the file.
Before starting task, create branch from current branch.
When task is finished, update document under the docs directory accoring to your changes.
And `*.md` file which you did move the file to `improvement/done` directory.
At last commit changes to the branch.

If `improvement/*.md` are left, repeat this step.
